  "Returns its argument, wrapped in a marker type that responds to the generic

  Symbols are automatically treated as [[literal-number]] instances, so

  ```clojure

  ```

  is equivalent to

  ```clojure
  (* 10 'x)
  ```

  If you pass an actual number, sicmutils will attempt to preserve exact values
  through various operations:

  ```clojure`
  (g/+ 1 (g/cos (g/* 2 (literal-number 4))))
  ;;=> (+ 1 (cos 8))
  ````

  Notice that the `(g/* 2 ...)` is evaluated, but `cos` evaluation is deferred,
  since the result is inexact. On the other hand, if the number is inexact to
  begin with:

  ```clojure
  (g/+ 1 (g/cos (g/* 2 (literal-number 2.2))))
  ;;=> 0.6926671300215806

  the system will go ahead and evaluate it."
