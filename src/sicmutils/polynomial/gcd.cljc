;; trivially without lowering arity.
;;
;; secondly, we observe that lowering arity often produces constant polynomials.
;; can we get away with just dropping these to scalars, instead of constant
;; polynomials of lower degree?
;;
;; then we could special-case the question of GCD of a polynomial with a basic
;; number. That's just the gcd of the number and the polynomial's integer
;; coefficients.
;;
;; open question: why was dividing out the greatest monomial factor such a lose?
;; it's much cheaper to do that than to find a gcd by going down the arity
;; chain.
