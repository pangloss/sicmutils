;; ## Vector Implementations
;;
;; Vectors are implicitly treated as [[sicmutils.structure/Structure]] instances
;; with an `up` orientation. They can act as `zero?`, but they can't act as
;; `one?` or `identity?`; those are reserved for instances that have no effect
;; on multiplication.
;;
(extend-type #?(:clj IPersistentVector :cljs PersistentVector)
  v/Value
  (zero? [v] (every? v/zero? v))
  (one? [_] false)
  (identity? [_] false)
  (zero-like [v] (mapv v/zero-like v))
  (one-like [v] (u/unsupported (str "one-like: " v)))
  (identity-like [v] (u/unsupported (str "identity-like: " v)))
  (exact? [v] (every? v/exact? v))
  (freeze [v] (mapv v/freeze v))
  (kind [v] (type v))

  ;; Another difference from [[sicmutils.structure/Structure]] is that a
  ;; structure of functions acts as a function itself that applies its entries
  ;; to its arguments. Vectors already implement IFn (they take an index and
  ;; look it up), so they can't respond the same way as a structure via
  ;; arity. (the `2` arity takes an additional default value.)
  f/IArity
  (arity [v] [:between 1 2])

  ;; Vectors are functors, so they can be perturbed if any of their elements are
  ;; perturbed. [[d/replace-tag]] and [[d/extract-tangent]] pass the buck down
  ;; the vector's elements.
  d/IPerturbed
  (perturbed? [v] (boolean (some d/perturbed? v)))
  (replace-tag [v old new] (mapv #(d/replace-tag % old new) v))
  (extract-tangent [v tag] (mapv #(d/extract-tangent % tag) v)))

;; ## Sequences
;;
;; Sequences can't act as functions or respond to any of
;; the [[v/zero?]]-and-friends predicates. They pass along the operations that
;; they can implement to their elements via [[map]].

;; ## Maps
;;
;; Maps acts as functors that can be perturbed and zeroed out (and pass along
;; calls to [[g/partial-derivative]] to their elements!), but not much else.
;;
;; NOTE: There is probably a case for making something
;; like [[sicmutils.structure/Structure]] backed by a map, for a sort of sparse
;; structure, or a dataframe-like structure with named fields instead of
;; positional fields. Nothing like this exists yet!
